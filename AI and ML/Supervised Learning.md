# Supervised Learning
- Trained on Labeled data 

## Types
- Regression
    - Used to predict a numeric value based on input data
    - The output variable is continous, meaning it can take any value within that range.
    - Examples:
        - Prediction of House Prices
        - Stock Price Prediction
        - Weather Prediction
- Classification
    - Used to predict categorical label of input data
    - The output variable is discrete, which means it falls into a specific category or class.
    - Examples:
        - Binary Classification
        - Multi-label Classification
    - **Algorithm** - kNN(k - nearest neighbours) model

# Training Set
- Used to train model, typically 60-80% of the dataset

# Validation Set
- Used to tune model parameters and validate performance, typically 10-20% of the dataset

# Test Set
- Used to evaluated the final model performance, typically 10-20% of the dataset

# Feature Engineering
- The process of using domain knowledge to select and transform raw data into meaningful features
- Helps enhancing the performance of machine learning models
- Techniques
    - Feature Extraction
    - Feature Selection
    - Feature Transformation
- Particularly meaningful for Supervised Learning.
- Structured Data
- Unstructured Data

# Unsupervised Learning
- Trained on Unlabeled data

## Types
- Clustering Technique
    - **Technique** - K-means clustering
    - The clusters can be labeled later on by humans
    - Example: Customer Segmentation
- Association Rule Learning Technique
    - **Technique** - Apriori Algorithm
    - Example: Market Basket Analysis
- Anomaly Detection
    - **Technique** - Isolation Forest
    - Example: Fraud Detection

# Semi-Supervised Learning
- Use a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data to train system.
- After that. the partially trained algorithm itself label the unlabeled data.
- This is called psuedo-labeling
- The model is then re-trained on the resulting data mix without being explicitly programmed.

# Fine Tuning a Model

## Instruction Based Fine Tuning
- Improves the performance of a pre-trained FM on domain specific taskss
- = further trained on a particular field or area of knowledge
- Instruction based fine tuning uses **labeled exampless** that are **prompt-responses pairs.**

### Single-Turrn Messaging

### Multi Turn Messaging

## Continued Pre-training
- Provide **unlabeled data** to continue the training of an FM.
- Alsso called **domain-adaptation fine-tuning**, to make a model expert in a specific domain
- For example: feeding the entire AWS doc to a model to make it an expert on AWS
- Good to feed industry-specific terminology into a model.
- Can continue to train the model as more data becomes available.

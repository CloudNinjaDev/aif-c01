# Prompt Engineering
- Prompt gives little guidance and leaves a lot to the model’s interpretation
- Developing, designing, and optimizing prompts to enhance thhe output of FMs for your needs

## Improved Prompting Techniques
- Instruction – a task for the model to do
- Context - external information to guide the model
- Input Data - the input for which you want a response
- Output indicator - the output type or format
